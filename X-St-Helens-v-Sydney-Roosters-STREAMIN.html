Wales head coach Frank Lampard: “Jose is a fantastic manager. Our relationship of working together changes, but we are very amicable and respectful of each other.

“I have huge respect for him. I am not thinking about the battle between me and him.”

Tottenham head coach Jose Mourinho: “The boys did fantastic to put themselves back in the positions where we belong, these positions fighting for the top four.

“The situation is difficult. I think nobody else in the Premier League for sure, but even in European football, is in such a difficult situation as we are in terms of injuries in specific positions.

“If we manage to finish fourth without Harry and Sonny it would be something incredible, incredible achievement for the boys.”.
